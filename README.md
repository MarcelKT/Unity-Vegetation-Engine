Vegetation painter, trying to replicate the effect from Jurassic World Evolution. It was written before JWE came out, based on what I saw in the promotional materials.

First iteration of the grid optimiser - this was eventually going to become a whole feeding/animal AI system.

I was going to add plant spreading, but I decided to first move the project to Unreal Engine IV (I missed the depth of C++ I could use for the grid and I generally prefer the environment provided there). I'll add that if I recover the files.
